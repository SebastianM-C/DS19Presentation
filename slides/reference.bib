Using Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science.},

  abstract = {We consider a model based on two coupled fourth-order oscillators that describes the intrinsic quadrupole vibrations of atomic nuclear surface in order to investigate the classical-quantum correspondence. We explore the role of the classical phase-space structure upon the statistical properties of energy levels distribution of the associated quantum system. A mixed distribution function, encoding two possible mechanisms for energy levels generation is proposed. Its features can be related to the relative weight of the regular and irregular volumes in the classical phase-space.},

@article{baranFolding2015,
  title = {Quantifying the Folding Mechanism in Chaotic Dynamics},
  abstract = {In this work we discuss different measures aimed to characterize the folding mechanism which together with the stretching process determine the chaotic dynamics. We show that from a study of the evolution of the distance between two trajectories beyond the exponential stage until the asymptotic regime is possible to obtain a quantity which provide an insight about this mechanism and its dependence on the control parameter. The asymptotic mean distance d{$\infty$} manifests a specific power law dependence at the transition to chaos and is quite complementary to Lyapunov exponent in characterizing the chaotic motion. Then based on the methods of inverse statistics applied to one-dimensional maps we advance an alternative measure able to reflect the folding mechanism on the strange attractors. In the final part we argue briefly that the inverse statistics can be a relevant tool to the study of earthquakes produced in the Vrancea region.},
