  \begin{itemize}
		\item The physical system that we model is the surface of heavy nuclei.

		motion of the vibrational quadrupole degrees of freedom of
		the nuclear surface.

\subsubsection{The \texttt{Julia} ecosystem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% slide 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{\texttt{Julia}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Numerical simulations and the visualizations of the
		results was done in \texttt{Julia} (\texttt{DifferentialEquations.jl}
		and \texttt{DynamicalSystems.jl} for simulations and respectively
		\texttt{Plots.jl} and \texttt{Makie.jl} for visualizations).
		\item Having access to the implementations of a large
		number of integrators helps us taking an informed decision
		for the choiche of the integration algorithm.

\subsubsection{The maximal Lyapunov exponent}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% slide 12 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Quantifying chaoticity}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The maximal Lyapunov exponent is defined as
		\[
			\lambda = \lim\limits_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{t} \ln{\frac{\dd{x}(t)}{\dd{x}(0)}}
		\]
		\item One of the signature characheristics of chaos is the sensitivity to the initial conditions	(\(\lambda > 0\)).
		\item We can get some intuitive insight for the sensitivity to
		the initial conditions by following the evolution of two nearby
		initial conditions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interactive exploratinos}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For a given set of parameters ($B$ and $E$) we have
		a set of compatible initial conditions.
		\item Poincaré sections give us a global picture of the
		dynamics.
		\item For a better (visual) understanding of the dynamics
		we can show the Lyapunov exponents on the Poincaré map.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{A note regarding the \(\lambda\) histogram}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Theoretically the Lyapunov exponent histogram should
		have two sharp peaks: one for the regular part and one for
		the chaotic one.
		\item The spread in the chaotic part is given by finite time
		effects.
		\item To better understand this we will take a look at how
		the integration time affects the results.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Averaging \(\lambda\) over the initial conditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We define the averaged Lyapunov coefficient as the
		mean of the maximal Lyapunov exponents in the chaotic region.
		\item We need a sufficiently robust method of selecting
		the \(\lambda\)s in the chaotic region.
		\item We consider as chaotic everything after the first
		local maxima in the histogram.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% slide 26 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Other indicators}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can look at the distance between two nearby
		trajectories in the limit of \(T \to \infty\) in order to
		get an estimate of the phase space volume.
		\item In a finite phase space volume we cannot have only an
		exponential divergence of trajectories, so there must be some
		something that folds the trajectories back after the initial
		divergence.
		\item We define \(\Gamma\) as a measure of folding
		\[
		\Gamma = \frac{\ee^\lambda - 1}{d_\infty}
		\]
		\item We can apply similar averaging techniques as for \(\lambda\).

	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Averaging \(\lambda\) over the energy}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can get a global picture of the sistem by integrating
		the averaged Lyapunov coefficient over an energy interval.
		\item For a small energy interval in the low energy limit we
		get a monotonusly increasing dependence.
		\item For a large energy interval we have a non-trivial
		dependence of the averaged Lyapunov exponent with respect
		to the non-integrability parameter $B$.
