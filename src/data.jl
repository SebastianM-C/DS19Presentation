	Here are the materials for the SIAM DS19 presentation entitled "Large-Scale Numerical Investigations into the Dynamics of Nonlinear Classical Systems". The dataset used for all the computations is included as the binary file graph.jls and it requires julia 1.1.0 and the two julia packages linked below to be correctly read. See the DS19Presentation GitHub repository linked below for more details on how to reproduce the presented figures.
